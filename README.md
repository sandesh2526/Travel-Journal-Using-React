## The Project

In this project we are replicating a API call with a js object which we are exporting from a file and then displaying that content dynamically using the React.

The number of card (The places traveled) can be added or removed using the "Data.js" file. This file contains the object that we use to replicate the API call. So adding the object with similar fields will result in addition of a place in the journal.
